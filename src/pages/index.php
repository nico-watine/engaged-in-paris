				<p><span class="lead heading bold">In 2014,</span> I proposed to Corinne while in France for a family wedding. Having been together for 8 years already, I knew she was the one. What better place to propose than the City of Love?</p>
				<p>We were married on February 20, 2016, in Sugar Land, Texas. It was the best day ever, and we want to thank everyone who helped make it so. We are incredibly grateful for all of the love, support and help from everybody that went into planning our wedding. Here are the stories and photos of our amazing day.</p>
