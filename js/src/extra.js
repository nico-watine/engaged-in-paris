// This file is to show how 'app.js' is for importing all of the Foundation-specific files
// 'extra.js' is a placehold file for any other script files
// 'extra.js' is minified via codekit, not via 'npm run build'
// when 'npm run build' is executed, 'extra-min.js' is simply copied over and not processed in any way
